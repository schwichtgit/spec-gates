# Intentionally NOT using set -e or trap ERR: the dispatch lib propagates
# non-zero exit codes from formatters that ran but failed, and we want to
# count them rather than abort on the first one. severity=error then maps
# the count to exit 2 explicitly at the bottom of this hook.

# Stop hook: batch-format all changed files. Runs before verify-quality.sh.
# Checks stop_hook_active for recursion guard.
#
# Policy:
#   - Sources policy.sh so the formatter dispatch can consult per-tool
#     exclude lists; without the loader, dispatch falls through unchanged.
#   - Reads the hook's own severity field. severity=error -> tool failure
#     blocks the stop with exit 2; severity=warning (default for this hook)
#     -> failure logs WARNING and exits 0.
#   - Without a loadable policy there are no exclude lists, and
#     formatting without them could rewrite vendored or generated
#     files, so the hook prints a one-line notice and formats nothing.
#     A project without the runtime projected is skipped silently.
