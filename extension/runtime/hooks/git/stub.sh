# spec-gates hook stub -- installed into .git/hooks as pre-commit and
# commit-msg by /speckit.gates.init (issue #59).
#
# .git/hooks is shared by every branch; the projected runtime is not. This
# stub runs the CHECKED-OUT branch's projected hook
# (.specify/gates/hooks/<name>), so the hook version always matches the
# branch's runtime and an upgrade takes effect without reinstalling hooks.
# Invoked through bash, so a projected hook that lost its execute bit (zip
# installs drop modes) still runs.
