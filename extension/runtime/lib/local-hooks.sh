#!/usr/bin/env bash
# local-hooks.sh -- project-owned rules that survive upgrades (#71).
#
# A project adds its own refusals as scripts in
#   .specify/gates/hooks.local.d/<hook>/*.sh
# where <hook> is protect-files, validate-bash, validate-pr, pre-commit or
# commit-msg. projection, upgrades and the manifest never touch that
# directory. Each hook runs the rules only after every shipped check
# allowed, so a rule can add a refusal but never remove one.
#
# Usage (sourced; bash 3.2):
#   gates_local_has <root> <hook>          # 0 if the hook has local rules
#   gates_run_local <root> <hook> [args]   # 0 = every rule allowed;
#                                          # 1 = refused, GATES_LOCAL_MSG set
#
# Each rule runs as `bash <rule> [args]` (execute bits do not matter), with
# GATES_LOCAL_STDIN on its stdin (the agent hooks pass the tool call JSON;
# the git hooks pass nothing), GATES_HOOK=<hook> and
# GATES_PROJECT_ROOT=<root> in its environment. Exit 0 allows; any other
# exit refuses, and the rule's stderr becomes the refusal message. Rules
# run in lexical order and the first refusal wins. A rule that cannot be
# read (unreadable, a directory, a dangling symlink) refuses: a rule the
# project wrote must never silently not run. A rule still running after
# GATES_LOCAL_TIMEOUT seconds (default 10) is killed with everything it
# started and refuses; so does a rule that exits but leaves a process
# running. A GATES_LOCAL_TIMEOUT that is not a whole number above 0
# refuses before any rule runs.

# open, and the hook would wait for it past any timeout (#189). The exit
# is the rule's; the state file GATES_LOCAL_STATE gets "timeout" when the
